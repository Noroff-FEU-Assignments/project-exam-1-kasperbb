                <p>
                    Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you
                    ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands
                    of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every
                    creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father,
                    hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every
                    "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a
                    sunbeam.

                    The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which
                    our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our
                    stand.
